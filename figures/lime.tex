(from \cite{Ribeiro0G16}) 
Toy example to present intuition for \lime{}.
The black-box modelâ€™s complex decision function $f$ (unknown to \lime{}) is represented by the blue/pink background, which cannot be approximated well by a linear model.
The bold red cross is the instance being explained.
\lime{} samples instances, gets predictions using $f$, and weighs them by the proximity to the instance being explained (represented here by size).
The dashed line is the learned explanation that is locally (but not globally) faithful.
